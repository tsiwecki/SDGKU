        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <div class="bio-container">
            <p>I graduated from San Diego Global Knowledge University with a certification in "Full Stack Development" and have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Police Administration.</p>
            <p>I served as an Army Signal Support Systems Specialist as an Army Battalion Communications Chief in the Texas Army National Guard. There, I planned, developed, coordinated, directed, and supervised the installation, operation and management of integrated C2 (command and control) telecommunications and information management networks; wrote C2 policy; provided technical advice and assistance to commanders, staff, and subordinate units; coordinated Signal activities with higher, lower and adjacent headquarters; performed Signal staff and Senior Operations NCO functions, to include writing policy, procedures, operations plans, orders, and reports; used computers to control and monitor network status in an operational environment; directed and assisted Battlefield Spectrum Managers in the development of frequency allocation plans; developed battlefield Signal operations plans in support of organizations at battalion and higher levels, and for Joint and Combined Commands and activities. From October 2008 until September 2011, I was assigned as a First Sergeant of a Communications Company conducting the same functions. I trained through the Army National Guard in real world situations utilizing these skill sets. In August 2005, I was deployed to Houston, Texas, for Hurricane Katrina and remained in Houston, Texas, through September and October 2005 to respond to Hurricane Rita.</p>
            <p>When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my wife and family outside, riding ATV's, BBQ'ing, fishing, and camping.</p>
