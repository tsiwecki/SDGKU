    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <p>In April 2004, while enlisted in the Texas Army National Guard, I graduated from 31U, Army Signal Support Systems Specialist, school. As an Army Battalion Communications Chief, I planned, developed, coordinated, directed, and supervised the installation, operation and management of integrated C2 (command and control) telecommunications and information management networks; wrote C2 policy; provided technical advice and assistance to commanders, staff, and subordinate units; coordinated Signal activities with higher, lower and adjacent headquarters; performed Signal staff and Senior Operations NCO functions, to include writing policy, procedures, operations plans, orders, and reports; used computers to control and monitor network status in an operational environment; directed and assisted Battlefield Spectrum Managers in the development of frequency allocation plans; developed battlefield Signal operations plans in support of organizations at battalion and higher levels, and for Joint and Combined Commands and activities. 
    <p>From October 2008 until September 2011, I was assigned as a First Sergeant of a Communications Company conducting the same functions.</p>
    <p>In addition to my Army Signal Specialist School, I attended the following Army schools: System Administration in Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003: Maintaining Resource Access, Windows Server 2003: Managing Hardware – Disks, Windows Server 2003: Managing the Server Environment, Basic Networking, Implementing Routine Protocols on CISCO, Managing IP Traffic on COSCO Networks, Network Services in Linux Environment, Operating and Configuring CISCO IOS Routers, and OSI Layer 3. From 2004 through 2006 I trained through the Army National Guard in real world situations utilizing these skill sets.</p>
    <p>In August 2005, I was deployed to Houston, Texas, for Hurricane Katrina and remained in Houston, Texas, through September and October 2005 to respond to Hurricane Rita. During this time, my sections primary responsibilities were to establish and maintain communications for all forward deployed units in our area, including air and land assets. My team and I established and maintained radio communications, VOIP phones, and computer networks for the deployed units in our area.</p> 
    <p>I retired from the US Army National Guard, after my third deployment, in 2013.</p>
